ABOUT
GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard) is jointly developed by S&P Dow Jones Indices 
and MSCI aimed at standardising global industry definitions. GICS provides us tools to to compare companies of 
similar operations. The more specialised the category is the better the comparison. 
For example a comparison between BHP (Mining Co) and CBA (Bank) is not as fair as comparing CBA to NAB (Bank)
Using data from history and outstanding tables we can identify the best performing company it is classification

In Australia we can trade shares (a partial ownership in a company) for money. A person can have multiple 
different shares in different company and a company can trade with any one person. The records of transactions
between a person and a company is recorded in the transaction table

List is used to help us to create plans. A transaction can be record against a list, for example we want 
to develop a plan to invest in the short term and in the long term. In the short term we could have transaction 
with BHP, however in the long term list we CBA and NAB. List also have master list for hierarchical organisation
